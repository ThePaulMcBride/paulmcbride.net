Your privacy is important to me.

It is my policy to respect your privacy regarding any information I may collect while operating my website. Accordingly, I have developed this privacy policy in order for you to understand how I collect, use, communicate, disclose and otherwise make use of personal information. I have outlined our privacy policy below.

- I will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.
- Before or at the time of collecting personal information, I will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
- I will collect and use personal information solely for fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other ancillary purposes, unless I obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
- Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
- I will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
- I will make readily available to customers information about my policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.
- I will only retain personal information for as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.

I am committed to conducting my business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained. I may change this privacy policy from time to time at my sole discretion.
