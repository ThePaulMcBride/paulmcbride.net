If you fail to comply with any of the terms or conditions contained therein, you will be prohibited from accessing the above website. All content and materials contained within this website are protected by the appropriate copyright and trademark legislation.

## Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on my website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

- modify or copy the materials;
- use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
- attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on my website;
- remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
- transfer the materials to another person or “mirror” the materials on any other server.

This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by me at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

## Disclaimer

The materials on my website are provided on an ‘as is’ basis. I make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

## Modifications

I may revise these terms of service for my website at any time without notice. By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.
