Hi I'm Paul McBride! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software developer, instructor, and tech nerd currently living in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

I bootstrapped [WeCode NI](https://wecodeni.com), a job board for developers in Northern Ireland, I'm an [egghead instructor](https://egghead.io/instructors/paul-mcbride?af=auhexg), and currently I work at [Niice](https://niice.co).

Here's how this works:

- You give me your email address
- I'll send you a few emails each month sharing about what I'm learning and working on
- You can unsubscribe whenever you like

I write about JavaScript, related tools/frameworks like React and Express, software principles and life in general.
